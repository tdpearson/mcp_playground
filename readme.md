# Experimentation with MCP and API Interactions with SHAREOK
These are examples of my experimenting with leveraging LangChain and the Model Context Protocol to provide context to LLMs from SHAREOK.org. This also uses the hosted open source models available through the National Research Platform's Nautilus cluster.

## How To Use
Get a LiteLLM auth token from NRP or change the ChatOpenAI settings to use an LLM provider you have access to.
The oai_pmh_playground notebook is intended as an example on how to bulk download metadata for a given collection - in this case OU Dissertations.

## Known Issues
The examples are not complete and will not handle large token responses from SHAREOK's API query results.
...and many others
